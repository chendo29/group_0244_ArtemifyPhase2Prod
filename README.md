Welcome to Artemify by Group_0244!

To use our program,

1. Run the app on AVD Pixel 2 API 30.

2. Click on the "POPULATE ENTITIES" button to have some users, songs, playlists, and a queue (with 
some songs preloaded) created beforehand, for testing and demonstration purposes. To see what these 
entities are you can take a look at the .csv files in the "demoentities" package. 

3. Click the "START" button to start using the app. (If you want to use admin commands, there is an 
initial admin user already created with username "adminUser" and password "pwd4".)
